						<h3><b><u>Review</u></b></h3><br><b>Looking for a Stock Android experience? Want a great quality camera in your phone? The Google Pixel 4 is the phone for you. The best in class camera, latest specs and stock android with atleast 2-3 years of support are some of the selling points of the new Pixel. Google's latest flagship android smartphone, The Pixel 4. The phone that has the best camera according to the tech industry. The Pixel 4 was launched in 2019, and has been the contender for top smartphones this year too. The phone has the Snapdragon 855 processor, which is last year's processor. But still the phone performs well with the inclusion of 6GB of RAM. The screen has grown now, it is a 5.7 inch screen which is a HDR compatible 90Hz FullHD+ display. This makes the whole android UI experience very smooth indeed. But this takes toll on the battery. The battery capacity is very low at 2800Mah, this does not last long for such powerful hardware and bright screen. This pixel does not have a 3.5mm jack too, but has a USB-C port for charging as well as wireless charging. With all said, this phone is for those android enthusiasts who want a proper stock android experience with no bloatware and proper support from  the manufacturer. Being a Google device, it is expected that this device may get frequent updates for couple of years. After the launch in 2019, the phone's price has gone down significantly and can be obtained for around the $500-$600 range. Check out the phone in the link below.
