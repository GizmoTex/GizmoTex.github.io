						<h3><b><u>Review</u></b></h3><br><b>Searching for a gaming laptop with decent power at an affordable rate? The Lenovo L340 gaming laptop might be your next buy. The laptop has enough power to run AAA games at 60FPS, yet the design remains understated rather than the gamery red and black theme. Lenovo certainly knows how to deliver to masses. And with this gaming laptop, Lenovo has done it again. The laptop is affordable, comes with proper specs, does not scream "GAMING" and gives an overall good experience to the users. This laptop is an entry level gaming laptop for those who are starting out in gaming and are not looking to shell out a whole lot of money. This lenovo l340 gaming laptop can be a good option for students for university or college work, as it does not have the gamery vibe to it. The laptop is pretty understated and has a good feel to it with its soft plastic shell. The specs on this laptop is adequate for many. With the Intel's 9th Generation processors it is quite powerful and ccan be used for day to day task as well as some intense works of designing, programming or video editing. For the price of $799, it is a good option for many as this laptop is an all-rounder with decent perfomance on hand. Check out the Lenovo l340 in the below.
