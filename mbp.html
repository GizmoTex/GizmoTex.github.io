The $1000 iPhone is out of your reach? But still want an iPhone with great specs? This iPhone SE is the one to go. The new SE is based on iPhone 8, but packs the latest processor and specs. Click here to know more. 2020 is the year when Apple has finally decided to return back to Steve Jobs' original intention. To reach out with their products in every common man. And with this new cheap yet powerful iPhone, they certainly have achieved it. The specifications of this iPhone seems too good to be true, but its actually the specs of the flagship iPhone 11 pro. The only changes or differences in this model are the screen size, battery and camera to some extent. But that differences makes the iPhone SE so cheap and affordable. Looking at the build quality, the body of this phone is reminiscent of the iPhone 8. It is a 4.7 inch screen with touch-id and big bezels. The back is made out of glass and chassis is unibody aluminium. This makes the phone sturdy and compact. The phone supports fast charging too. This phone is not typically for the Tech-savvy or the people who buy the latest and greatest, but for those who are still using an old phone, presumably an old iPhone and want a new refresh without spending too much. And there are still many people who likes small form factor devices. Moreover, this phone can be an entry for android users too. All in all, this $400 iPhone has to be the Value-for-Money iPhone ever to be created.
